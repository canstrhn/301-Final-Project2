CET 301 Software Report
1.	Software Introduction
Programming language: Dart
Programming tool: Flutter
2.	Software Design
a.	Purpose of the Program
Due to the lack of infrastructure in most universities, note display systems solve and do not work properly. Also, students have difficulties in keeping track of their exam and homework due to the busy school life. Thanks to the program that I have written, students can view the exact equivalent of their exam notes without any problems. I designed an application to facilitate homework and grade follow-up. 
b.	Problem Solution
The program consists of three screens. On the main screen, the student can learn the estimated letter grade by entering the name of the course, midterm, and final exams. On the second screen, the student can save the letter grades. On the third screen, the student can list the homework and exams he / she has to do and mark the homework he / she has worked on and completed.
c.	End User (Interface) Oriented Design
In the application, all data about the courses will be taken from the student. When the student presses the calculation button, the letter grade will be calculated according to the catalog grading system and will be shown in the relevant part of the screen.
If the student wishes, he / she can list the letter grades that are the output of the application. Can create to-do lists for homework, exam and project follow-up.
d.	Errors and Emissions 
The grading system and grade weights may differ in some courses. I used the standard grading system determined by the Bogazici University in the program I designed, but it may not give correct results for every course. Some courses may have more than one midterm exam. However, the user is not offered an option such as adding an exam or homework. these parts of the application can be improved. The screen, where the letter grades of the lessons are listed, can be designed and improved so that the student can add and subtract.
